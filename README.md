# Project[0]

The name "*Project[0]*" is just a placeholder name for this project while the Core Team still finalizes it.

The project will be an expense tracking app with collaboration functionality for friends and colleagues. The project is still in its infancy and the codebase is still small, with no goals set and roadmaps established yet. These will be ironed out as the project moves forward.
