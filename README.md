# Project[0]

*Project[0]* is just a placeholder name for this project while the Core Team still finalizes the name.

This will be an expense tracking app with collaboration functionality for friends and colleagues. The project is still in its infancy and the codebase is still small, with no goals set and roadmaps established yet. These will be ironed out as the project moves forward.

The following details are yet to be written:

## What does this project do?

## Why is this project useful?

## How do I get started?

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
